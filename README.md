An app for astronomers I developed over the summer.

"Alpha" was copyright-protected, so I settled for Alpha for Astronomy. 

The goal of developing Alpha for Astronomy was to eliminate the need for fiddling with several different apps when planning astronomy. It integrates weather, observational, and planning software into one simple app. 

Alpha for Astronomy uses Flutter's Cupertino library extensively. I developed a specialized web API, https://api.alpha-astro.com, for providing data to this app. I used Flask and hosted it on Amazon. 

My reasoning behind developing an API was that it would be easier to use AstroPy and PyEphem than learn how to do astronomy math on my own. This was not entirely true, and the API delayed the projecy considerably. Although, it could be ported to other applications in the future.
